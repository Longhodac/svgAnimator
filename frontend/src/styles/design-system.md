# Aurelian Design System

## Concept & Name
**Aurelian** (meaning "golden") was a Roman emperor (270–275 AD) who inherited a collapsing empire and single-handedly reunited it. He was a builder, a fixer, and a relentless executor — not flashy, just effective. He got things done that people thought were impossible.

This product is an AI-powered scene animation editor that orchestrates a pipeline of agents (a code agent writing GSAP, and a visual evaluation agent that reviews and loops back). The end result is a polished, exported SVG animation. Think of it as a creative studio tool for developers and motion designers who want to generate and refine animated scenes without doing everything by hand.

## Brand Identity
- **Tone:** Casual but considered. Not corporate. Not trying too hard. Confident, minimal, with a quiet nod to craft and history. Independent studio energy.
- **Color Palette:**
  - Background: Deep Black (`#000000`, `#050505`) to keep the focus on the work.
  - Surfaces: Very dark greys (`#0a0a0a`, `#111111`) for subtle elevation.
  - Typography Primary: Muted/Soft White (`#e5e5e5`) rather than blinding white.
  - Typography Secondary: Muted greys (`#888888`, `#666666`) for technical details.
  - **Accents:** Warm Gold (`#d4af37`, `#bca354`, or a glowing yellow-gold `rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.4)`) to reflect the name's meaning.
- **Typography:**
  - **Serif (Wordmark/Headers):** Elegant, historical but sharp serif (e.g., Playfair Display) for the logo and primary statements. Quiet nod to craft.
  - **Sans-Serif:** Clean, understated sans (Montserrat/Inter) for body text and functional UI.
  - **Monospace:** For tags, technical details, code snippets, indicating the tool's developer-focused utility.

## UI Components
- **Borders & Shapes:** Minimalist. Thin 1px borders (`border-white/10` or a very faint gold). Corners can be slightly rounded (`rounded-lg`, `rounded-2xl`) but shouldn't feel overly playful or bouncy.
- **Wordmark:** Clean serif, lowercase or sentence case, not shouting. "Aurelian" with perhaps a subtle gold period or accent.
- **Layout:** High use of negative space, asymmetrical balance. Let the typography and the canvas breathe. Think art-direction, not dashboard.
